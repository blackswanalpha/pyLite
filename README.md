# PyLite

**PyLite** is a lightweight, versatile framework designed to facilitate the development of applications across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. By integrating Flask for the backend and Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend, PyLite provides a seamless development experience, allowing you to create, manage, and deploy applications efficiently.

## Key Features

### Multi-Platform Support
- **Desktop Applications**: Utilize Electron with Next.js for creating powerful desktop applications.
- **Web Applications**: Leverage React with Next.js to build modern, responsive web applications.
- **Mobile Applications**: Use React Native to develop cross-platform mobile applications.

### Database Connectivity
- Connect to various database management systems (DBMS) like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.
- Seamlessly manage user-defined databases and their tables.
- Integrate SQLAlchemy for robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Simplified project creation with a single command: `pylite create <project_name>`.
- Easy application management and execution: `pylite run --platforms backend desktop web mobile`.
- Customizable platform selection to run only the desired environments.

### Project Structure
- **Configurable Settings**: Centralized configuration management through `config.py`.
- **Routing**: Custom URL routing for different platforms managed via `url.py`.
- **Components & Services**: Modular components and services architecture, inspired by FastAPI, for easy CRUD operations and model management.
- **Schema Management**: Define custom data schemas with `schema.py` for better data handling and validation.
- **Development Logging**: Automatic logging of development activities and debugging information in `development.log`.

### Templates
- Predefined templates for common components like blog models (`models.py`) and services (`service.py`).
- Templates for platform-specific settings and URL management.

### Integration
- Seamless integration with Electron for desktop applications, enabling Next.js for frontend rendering.
- Ability to send and receive data between Flask (backend) and Next.js (frontend).
- Storage and asset management via a configurable assets directory in `config.py`.

## Installation

To install PyLite, simply use pip:

```sh
pip install pylite
```

## Usage

### Creating a New Project

To create a new PyLite project, use the `create` command:

```sh
pylite create my_project
```

This will generate a new project directory with the necessary files and structure.

### Running the Project

To run your PyLite application, specify the platforms you want to run:

```sh
cd my_project
pylite run --platforms backend desktop web mobile
```

### Customization

You can customize the configuration and settings for each platform by editing the respective `url.py` and `settings.py` files in the `platform/` directory. Define your data models in `schema.py` and manage CRUD operations in `service.py`.
